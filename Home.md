The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time passcode generators for several mobile platforms, as well as a pluggable authentication module (PAM). One-time passcodes are generated using open standards developed by the [Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)](http://www.openauthentication.org/)  (which is unrelated to [OAuth](http://oauth.net/ OAuth)).
